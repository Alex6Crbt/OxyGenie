    Welcome to OxyGenie, a Python-based project dedicated to modeling and predicting tissue oxygenation.
	Tissue oxygenation is a vital process that depends on the efficiency of gas exchange between blood capillaries and cells. To better understand these exchanges, we aim to simulate the O2 diffusion processes and predict variations in oxygenation levels within tissues under various conditions.
	To achieve this, we employ finite differences to simulate the diffusion of oxygen in tissue, along with a modified UNet model to speed up the simulations.
