API Reference
=============

This section provides detailed documentation for the modules and functions available in the **OxyGenie** package. The package is organized into several sub-modules, each responsible for different aspects of tissue oxygenation modeling and prediction:

- **OxyGenie.diffusion**: Contains functions for modeling oxygen diffusion processes in tissue.
- **OxyGenie.learn**: Includes tools for training and using machine learning models to predict oxygen concentration variations.
- **OxyGenie.pgvnet**: Provides components for network-based models of vascular structures.

For detailed information on each sub-module, please refer to the individual documentation pages linked below :
